<p>News of Nigel's death reached us from the Electronic Telegraph via Patrick Kelly.</p>
<pre>Date: Mon, 24 Jul 2000 02:51:49 +0100 (BST)<br>From: "Patrick.Kelly" &lt;Patrick.Kelly@uk.sun.com&gt;<br>Subject: Nigel Thomas killed.<br>To: ixion@nottingham.ac.uk<br><br>Just read this on the Electronic Telegraph:<br><br>AN experienced parachutist who recently learned to "skysurf" fell to his death<br>when his snowboard became entangled in his emergency parachute in a 15,000ft<br>jump.<br><br>Fellow parachutists at Headcorn aerodrome, Kent, yesterday spoke of their<br>horror as they saw 36-year-old Nigel Thomas spiralling down and trying to<br>disentangle himself after his main parachute failed to open.<br><br>[...]<br><br>RIP<br><br>Pat<br></pre>
<p>Nigel had subscribed to Ogri/Ixion in the early days of the list and was known and liked by many. Our deepest sympathy to Victoria and to the rest of Nigel's family.</p>
<p>Nigel's funeral was held on Wednesday the 2nd of August 2000, at 2:30pm where donations to the Kent Air Ambulance were invited. At the ixion  anniversary party in Wandsworth on Friday the 4th of August 2000, the hat went  round for donations, and £115.91 was received.</p>
<hr><h2 align="center">Paul Yull</h2>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>Paul died doing something we all love, riding his motorcycle. He was a well respected member of Ixion, with many noticable postings and trip reports, as well as the author of an excellent guide to motorcycle touring: Paul's Touring FAQ. Some of his exploits were reported in: <a href="http://www.btinternet.com/%7Ekmbennett/alps97/index.htm">Paul and Marvin's Excellent Adventure</a>.</p>
<p>His funeral was held on Friday 29 May 1998 at 10:20. As a gesture of respect, only mail dedicated to the memory of Paul was allowed through Ixion between 10:00 and 14:00. <a href="/more-about-ixies/missed-ixies/ixion-a-tribute-to-paul-yull/">Here are some of these tributes</a></p>
<hr><h2 align="center">Adam Hebblewhite</h2>
<p align="center"> </p>
<p>Adams death was not motorcycle related.  His funeral was held on Saturday the 9th of May 1998, at 12pm at the Worth Crematorium, Crawley. Our condolences to his family.</p>
