Now that's a nice bit of tekkernology.

Hmm, I was already looking at the Notion Ink Adam as a successor to my
Advent Vega, might have to wait a bit to see what else comes out of
the woodwork.

ITIL is actually very good IF you treat it as the framework and set of concepts that it is.
Unfortunately;
A. It's in danger of becoming as much of a religion as nlp, and 
B. A lot of people really miss the point entirely
So it often ends up becoming a means unto itself and a major admin overhead .
If you ever meet anyone from the service management world ask them what the most important component of ITIL is. If they don't say the cmdb there's a pretty good chance they're a buffoon..
