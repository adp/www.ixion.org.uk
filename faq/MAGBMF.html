<P>Both charge about £12-15 per year, offer joint membership (two
members getting one copy of magazine etc. at one address) at less than double the single member rate, and you can probably get discounts on
stuff to repay the membership fees if you really care how much it costs
to protect your biking future...

<P>I am not going to tell you to join, but at least think about this:
if others had not done so, you would ALREADY probably be suffering from
leg protectors, two stage licences (I know one proud CB750 owner who'd
be stuck on a weedy 35bhp 400cc bike for at least one more year:-) and
who knows what else. Plus trivia like, you'd be banned from P&amp; O
Ferries if you bike was 5 years old or more...

<p>You can now also join <em>both</em> organisations by phone or via the internet so even if you are a lazy git like me, there's no excuse.

<P>(More than) nuff sed!

<P>NB: FEM (Federation of European Motorcyclists) are a bunch of noble
knights fighting for our cause in Europe. THEY DO NOT TAKE INDIVIDUAL
MEMBERSHIP these days - they take club memberships only, coordinate
<A HREF="http://www.mag-uk.org/">MAG</A>/<a href="http://www.bmf.co.uk">BMF</a> type
clubs all over Europe, find out what devilish work the Eurocrats are up
to and generally chat up Euro-MPs (who take them seriously).
