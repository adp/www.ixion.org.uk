<H2>Are <a href="http://www.scottoiler.com/"> Scotoilers</a> really that wonderful? Yes.</H2>

Hi All,

<P>Taranis wanted info on Scottoiler - they are a Glasgow-based
company. I	visited their factory in Milngavie a few weeks back to get
some extra tubing as mine slipped onto the exhaust after I fiddled with
it (phnarr).  There was a big ZZR1100 and a nice BMW75S parked outside,
belonging to some of the staff.  The boss is a dead keen biker (his was
the ZZR) - wanted to know what I thought of my GPZ, what was next, etc,
etc and he threw in a few connectors and fitting instructions for nowt. 
I was impressed by their setup.

<P>Course, the fact that they're from Glasgow should be recommendation
enough...  :)

<P>If Taranis (or anyone else) wants details, they are on +44(0)141- 955- 1100

<P>On another note, a rider in Belfast told me he'd bought a litre of
Scottoil (#8.50 a shot!) but he'd only needed half of that in 20K miles.

<P>Cheers, Johnny
