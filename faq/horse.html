<h2>How do I pass horses?</h2>
<p>The correct way to deal with Equine traffic is to approach 
from behind, close the throttle, pull the clutch in at a 
safe distance, and coast past at just over walking pace, 
giving the horse and rider plenty of space.</p>

<p>As you pass the rider will probably take a hand off the 
reigns to give a cheery wave in acknowledgement of your 
consideration, _this_ is your cue to drop two (or more) 
gears, wind the loud handle fully open, flip the kill 
switch a couple of times, and enjoy the impromptu Rodeo 
taking place in your rear view mirrors as you accelerate 
safely _out_ of the danger zone well clear of flying 
hooves...</p>

<p>Extra points are awarded if you're being tailgated by a 
4x4 with a "Countryside Alliance", BAFS, CPRE, or "Show 
Llama's in Transit" sticker in the window and you manage 
to get the horse onto the bonnet :-)<br><br>
