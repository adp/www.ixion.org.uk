<H2>Can anyone recommend a decent insurance co.?</H2>
<p>
There appears to be no <em>one</em> best insurance company. Lot's of people will swear by the one they use, but that is just likely to get a slating from someone else.&nbsp;
<p>
The following were recommended on the list in December 2004. Please email me if
you have a company you'd like to recomend.<br>

<a href="http://www.carolenash.com/">Carol Nash</a> very cheap if you have a
classic bike. Some people have had problems claiming with them, some have had
brilliant service.<br>

Simon Murfin said: Not made a claim, but do offer something approaching reasonable premiums
for a Blade in London.  Also offer second policies for second bikes at a 50% discount.<br>
