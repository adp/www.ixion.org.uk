<H2>Does stopping distance increase with a pillion?</H2>

[short answer: if you do things perfectly, it shouldn't]

<P>... if your brakes are up to it then you can chirp the tyres, and if
your tyres and differential front/back control (or ABS) are up to it
(i.e. front and rear tyres both chirping) then you can get up to 1.3G on
shell grip with the best road tyres; more usually up to 1G with usual
tyres on a good dry road. Irrespective of weight or type of vehicle.

<P>Cars without ABS suffer from not being able to brake both back and
front to maximum pre-slip braking under frontwards weight transfer.

<P>Bikes suffer from the fact that most riders are either too scared to
brake hard enough, or brake too hard and lose the bike.
