<H1>Donations to the upkeep of the Ixion server</H1>
<p>
We thought we would give you the opportunity to make a small voluntary donation
to the Ixion Coffers.
As some of you may know, Ixion was evicted from its traditional home in
Nottingham early in 2002, and since then has been resident on a server owned by
EKS companies 
<a href="http://www.yellowduck.co.uk/">Yellowduck</a>
and
<a href="http://www.redpoint.org.uk/">Redpoint Consulting</a>
(<I>aka</I> your humble servants, Ixies
<A HREF="http://www.adamanda.org/">Adam Curtin</A>
&amp; Robin Szemeti).
</p>
<p>
The server costs us, personally, umm ... quite a lot - and Ixion is by far and
away the largest user of the bandwidth. To give you an idea - we process around
1,500 incoming messages for ixion each week, which are sent out to around 400
subscribers. That's around 600,000 outgoing messages a week, or 2.4
<i>million</i> messages a month. It uses around 2.5GB a month of bandwidth for
the ixion mailing list alone, and of course there's the hosting and
webmastering of this website on top. We manage the server, tend to the needs of
Ixies and keep it fed and watered for the love of it.
</p>
<p>
<B>Ixion is free</B>. We would never <I>dream</I> of making a charge for using
Ixion. No Way. Never.
<BR>But (theres always a but <TT>;-)</TT> ) we won't be offended if you wish to
make an (entirely voluntary) donation towards the running costs. 
</p>

<p><b>If you'd like to contribute</b>, we've chosen <I>PayPal</I> as our easy
payment mechanism. Just type an amount below, click donate, and follow the
instructions. Because they are a US based outfit the amounts are in dollars,
but it all ends up in pounds eventually. The money goes to
<A HREF="http://www.redpoint.org.uk/">Redpoint Consulting</A>
and will contribute towards the Ixion running costs
<SMALL>(with <I>hardly any</I> of it being used to fund Robin's wild
nights of debauchery with the Swedish Women's Ice-hockey Team <TT>:-)</TT>
).</SMALL>
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, <b>direct bank transfer</b> is slightly less easy, but has the
advantage that it all gets to us (without Paypalkeeping some). If you'd like to
do that, please email Adam for info. If you're <i>really</i> keen, you could be
one of Ixion's <i>best</i> friends and set up a standing order <tt>:-)</tt>
</p>

<p>
As a token of our appreciation we will add your name to our
<a href="/cgi-bin/friends.pl">Friends Of Ixion</a>
page.
</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Remember - <B>It's entirely voluntary</B>: if you don't wish to contribute -
don't. It's no big deal.  We hope that what we do for you is useful and
appreciated, and we know that some folk want to help out, but if you don't then
that's fine.  Honest.

<p>
So, without further procrastination:
