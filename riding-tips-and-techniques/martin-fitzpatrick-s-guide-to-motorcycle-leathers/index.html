<hr><p>How do you tell good leathers from bad ?  This is a question that has been bothering me a lot of late, and I've been  taking a look into the whole thing. I've taken a bit of time and trouble to  dig up the information, and I thought someone out there might benefit from it;  especially since one thing has become clear to me - you do not always get what  you pay for.</p>
<p>The waters are very muddied, claims and counter claims abound, and  it's all pretty difficult to make sense of. I've spent time reading magazine  articles, reading sales brochures, talking to experts and talking to assholes.  The result is an IMPRESSION of what to look for in good leathers - feel free  to agree or disagree, but do me one favour - don't confuse the issue too much  with your postings. I'll be glad to get <em>mail</em> about anything you want to  discuss, but please only <em>post</em> stuff that you think will contribute to the  thread. Thanks.</p>
<p>Also, I see a lot of  "<em>I know better than you</em> / <em>No you don't</em> / <em>Yes I do</em>" crap  out there. In posting this stuff I'm not trying to prove that I'm the god of  leathers or some shit. I admit openly that I know diddly-squat about the  subject - I'm only posting this because if some poor sucker out there knows  less about it than me (and I fell into that category a few weeks ago), then  they might appreciate this information (I know I would have). Don't flame me for being a smartass - I'll just get angry and you wouldn't like me when I'm  angry. Also, please don't turn this into a discussion about whether leathers  are a good thing/necessity/waste of time - I have plenty of views on that  subject myself, but this is neither the time nor the place.</p>
<p>Okay, so I walk into a shop and they've got rows and rows of leathers. Where  do I start ? Well, there are a lot that you can just walk right by, but you  probably knew that already. Anything that looks more like a bondage jacket  than a motorcycle jacket probably is what it looks like. Little straps on the  shoulders, tassels (pleeeease !), studs (you-gotta-be-fuckin-kidding),  distressed leather (you would be too), zip-off sleeves (no, really I have seen  it, honest), ultra-soft leather, baggy jackets - even if you like these  things, it should be obvious that these were made not to save your skin but to  make a fashion statement. Fashion statements loose some of their impact when  delivered from a hospital bed. If you really are worried about fashion and  "pulling the chics" and so on, think on this - would <em>you</em> French-kiss someone  with a skin-graft?</p>
<p>Right, we've got past the Ugly, only the Good and the Bad left. How do we tell  them apart ? Have you ever seen a suit of racing leathers ? Well, here's the  bad news - they're boring (apart from the colour schemes). None of the Mad Max  shoulder pads or any of that shit - just plain old leather, and lots of it.  They have almost no straps anywhere, no pockets, very few fastenings. They  also have as few seams as possible, by being constructed of only a few, large,  pieces of leather. This reduces the number of seams - seams being the weak  points of a suit. Racing leathers are also skin tight.</p>
<p>No, I'm not suggesting that we all run out and buy one piece racing suits. My  point is that if the leathers you're looking at look not at all like race  leathers, then this probably tells you something about their quality. Not  definitely, but probably. Anything <em>extra</em> is probably making things worse -  eg. straps, zippers, studs, etc - they weaken the leather and in a crash will  either dig into your flesh, or rip off, leaving your flesh rubbing along the  road. Use your common sense - if it looks silly, it probably is. Don't buy  leathers with "I'm a dork" spelled out in metal studs on the back just cos the  salesman says they're great.</p>
<p>Okay, so I've settled on something that looks the part. Is it as good as it  looks ? Close inspection time. The easiest thing to check is just the shape of  the jacket. If someone tried to physically pull it off you, would it come off  easily ? If so, it will definitely come off in a crash. The arms should get  narrower towards the wrist, to stop them sliding up your arms. The body should  be shaped to stop it riding up your torso.</p>
<p>Next, the zips. These should NOT be metal - they should be nylon, but good  chunky ones all the same. How do you tell what they're made of? Simple, the  metal ones look like metal ! If they don't look like metal, they probably  aren't, because most makers leave the metal bare because paint would just chip  off. Any coloured zips will probably be nylon (even if the colour is black).  Another good clue is that cuff (ie. wrist) zips should be on the inside of the  arm, not the outside. If they haven't got that right, they've probably made  some other mistakes as well.</p>
<p>Next, the stitching. Just take a good look at it. You should expect to see  double stitching (ie. two rows of stitching side by side) on all the major  seams - front, shoulders, etc. Is the stitching regular (ie. the gaps between  the stitches are the same size) ? Are there any <em>dropped</em> stitches (ie. the  thread just goes straight for a bit where'd you'd expect a stitch to be) ?  Learn to recognise an inch - for me this is the distance from the tip of my  index finger to the first knuckle. Find a similar handy (no pun intended)  measure. Count the number of stitches in an inch - there should be more than 7  and less than 12 (usually 7-8 or 10). Too few and the stitching is too weak -  too many and the leather will be weakened by the stitching.</p>
<p>Now the actual construction of the leather. Easiest to check are the areas  where there should be double thickness leather. These are your "impact points"  - the knees, hips/arse, elbows and shoulders (UK arse = US ass). How do you  tell if they're double thickness ? In some cases, it looks really obvious,  because an extra piece of leather is stitched onto the outside - however, you  still have to check that the it has been layed on top of the original leather,  and not just sew in (which would be very bad news). Get one hand inside and one  outside. If it's double-layered, you should be able to separate the layers a  little by working at it with both hands. Also of great importance is a quick  look at how the garment has been designed. Has it been put together with the  minimum number of "panels" (the separate pieces of leather which make up the  garment) - remember : the more panels, the more seams; the more seams, the  weaker the leathers. How do you tighten/loosen them ? Are there buckles or  stretch panels ? Buckles should be far enough away from the impact points to  avoid them digging into you when you meet the tarmac. Stretch panels are  generally made of a thinner leather, so they also should not be too near to  the impact points. The most important thing is actually the most difficult to  work out - the thickness of the leather. For this you'll just have to check  the labels, or ask the staff. The leather should be at LEAST 1mm thick -  anything thinner is complete crap : most decent suits will have at least 1.3mm  and maybe up to 1.5mm if your lucky.</p>
<p>Right, now we come to the area that had me REALLY digging. Padding/Body  armour. Everybody talks about it. If you listen to the advertising, Joe  Bloggs' leathers are better than everyone else's because they've got  Protectoshite body armour. The beauty of it all is that is that almost all of  it is actually complete crap!</p>
<p>Looking about, I could see all these claims and counter-claims, and I knew  they couldn't ALL be true, so I did some research. Eventually I got back to  what seems to me to the proverbial horse's mouth. The guy's name is Dr Rod  Woods, and he works in Cambridge, England, UK. He has a materials testing lab  where he's working on a new EC Personal Protective Equipment Directive (EC =  European Community). He seems to know what he's talking about, and he doesn't  mind talking about it - even to the likes of me. I won't tell you how to  contact him because the guy has a job to do and he won't be too pleased with  me if I set the whole internet to phoning him all the time. If you're any good  at research and you WANT to, you'll be able to find him as well.</p>
<p>What this guy told me was that there's only one sort of padding that's worth  having, and almost nobody uses it ! It's made of a compound call  Polynorbonene (it should be 8mm thick), and it sells (in Europe) under two  trade names, Norsorex and Noene. It's a SOFT padding. The Doc says HARD  padding in a complete no-no. In the first place it doesn't absorb impact - it  passes it straight on to your body. In the second place, the rigid shape of  the pad is likely to rip straight out of the leathers, leaving your skin to  get acquainted with the ground. "But", I said to the good doctor "Surely hard  pads help if the hit something sharp." "Well, it might," says he, "but  statistically speaking, that doesn't happen !"  This is when we got into an  involved discussion about statistics.</p>
<p>Now, the following piece is based on the Good Doctor's knowledge of the  statistics. Me, personally, I don't want to argue with the guy. It seems to me  that he's been in contact with most of the major hospitals in the UK. I can't  compete with that personally.</p>
<p>The Good Doctor tells me that, statistically speaking, you want to protect  yourself from the feet up. He tells me about this idea of a rating of the  frequency with which an injury occurs (over, say the UK in a year) and the  dehabilitation caused by the injury. Turn the statistics into betting odds,  and we're talking about your chances of not being able to walk after a crash.  Now, the Good Doctor says that this rating DECREASES as you go up the body,  ie.fewer people are dehabilitated from chest injuries or back injuries than  from foot injuries. Yes, I found it hard to believe too, but he's got the st atistics ! That means, protect your feet first, then your legs, then your  body. He admits that there's a peak at the head, ie. the head causes more  dehabilitation than the body, but from there down, this rule holds.</p>
<p>I openly admit that this all came as news to me. I told him all sorts of  scenarios - chest injuries from upper body impact : ruptured kidneys from back  impact : broken back from back impact - he told me that statistically  speaking, they just don't happen. Back injuries seldom happen to bikers - and  those that do would not be prevented by back protectors. "How so ?", I ask  him. Well, statistically speaking, all back injuries in bikers (and they're  few and far between) involve bending or twisting of the back - like when you r shoulder or chin hits the ground hard, with resultant detrimental effects  on your back. Back protector won't help there, pal. He tells me that broken  ankles are the most common injury you can imagine. Compare them to broken  backs and you're talking mountains and molehills. Surprising stuff. Time to  revise my ideas on protection.</p>
<p>Okay, so what can we draw from all this. Polynorbonene is the only padding to  have. I don't know of anyone in the US supplying the stuff, and only three in  the UK. Please e-mail me for details, if you want. On the other hand, I'm sure  you're going to turn round and tell me that the stuff has been in the US for  years, and how come we haven't heard of it?</p>
<p>The next point is very interesting - you need more protection to your feet and  legs than to any other part of the body (apart from the head). How many  salespeople have you heard saying that ? "None" is my answer. So don't believe  the salespeople.</p>
<p>So to sum up, my advice to anyone thinking about leathers would be as follows :-</p>
<ol><li>Before you do anything else, go out and buy yourself a decent       pair of  boots, with built-in ankle protection. By that,       I don't mean armour in the  boot, what's more important is       that the boot grips the ankle so that any  twisting or bending       action is prevented. Take a look at a good quality pair of       mountaineering boots for an example of this. They're built       specifically to  protect against this, since it's easy to       break an ankle on uneven ground and  it's then a big problem       getting home. </li>
<li>Then buy yourself  a good pair of leather jeans, double-layered       in the  right places, and padded (in the same places) with       Polynorbonene (if you can  find it). </li>
<li>Lastly, buy a jacket with the same double-layering and       padding rules. </li>
</ol><p>Right, as soon as I post this, I'm sure half the net is going to flame me, but  what the hell. I wrote it in the hope that it would be of some help to  someone, and I stand by that.</p>
<p>Good luck with your leathers!</p>
