I'm sorry to have to give you the worst possible news: Jeff's gone.

He died at 2 this afternoon. His blood pressure had fallen so low; they
couldn't bring him back up again, he was fighting on too many fronts.

He didn't re-gain consciousness properly after the accident: he was sedated
and probably spent the entire time dreaming of riding in Norway.

I'm sorry to every one of his friends who has had to find this out from the
list: we tried to set a grapevine in motion but we don't have everyone's
phone number, I'm sorry if we have your number but haven't rung you, I'm
sorry to have to post this at all. He was my friend and he was yours too.

Bugger :-(

Richard :-(

Bugger indeed; I have been worrying about this constantly. I'm devastated by
the news. Jeff was one of the top people I've known; always gentlemanly,
always positive and supportive, always joining in.

I was hoping to do one of the European runs in his company some time; that
chance has now gone.

I hope Richard's right and that he never felt any pain; it's small
consolation, but you have to look for small mercies.

Jeff, goodbye mate, and have fun wherever you are. I can hardly see to type
through the tears; but I hope you're having the last laugh.

RIP old son.

:-(((((((

PS Richard - we all owe you a debt of gratitude for playing the difficult
role of intermediary in this tragic series of events, and Marvin and Pete,
we're all thinking of you two as well.

I can't believe we'll never see him again.

I don't know what to say, I only knew Jeff through the list and  never met
him, but why is it always the decent guys ?
I suppose all I can say is that at least he went doing something he loved,
and in such a nice area, judging by the photos.
Please pass on my deepest sympathies to Linda who of course is at the centre
of all this, and also to Marvin and Pete as well.
I really don't know what to say.  I've never had to do this before,  if
there's anything I can do to help anyone, please get in touch with me, I'm
off work this week.

Ixion is more than just a mailing list, it's like a family. And today we

I can't tell you how upset I was to get your call. I didn't think=

It's amazing how saintly people become when you hear people talk=

I made a mistake at the weekend and span the car on the Ring. A=

I think it's September. Ironic that Jeff should have been the one to
push Richard into cat-herding mode to organise it.

Dee and I are both going to miss him a lot.

An excellent idea.

Could I also suggest that we might follow the protocol established when we 
lost Paul Yull by reserving am Ixion Digest solely for people to pay 
respects and/or tribute? - It worked rather well for Paul, and, while God 
knows I hope it doesn't happen again in my tenure on Ixion, it has the 
makings of a fine and honourable tradition for dealing with such things...

It seems like only yesterday that I spent a very congenial couple of hours 
with Jeff in the "quiet area" of the Ben-my-Cree, watching the Irish sea 
go past on the way home from Keith's party[1] and the un-TT. I guess there 
are much worse ways to remember people. We also enjoyed a couple of very 
pleasant meals in a Chinese restaurant in Ramsey, and I think I spoke with 
Jeff more on that trip than I did in all the rest of the time I've known 
him. As the conversation touched on the time he'd spent as a magistrate, 
and the attitudes that had informed him in his business career I gained a 
hell of a lot of respect for him as a thoroughly decent man who'd put a 
lot of time and effort into trying to do The Right Thing, and to make his 
corner of the world a better place to be.

I hope this won't come over as frivolous, but for the last few days it's 
been on my mind that I owe Jeff for a cup of coffee and a Danish Pastry 
from that last journey, and I was very much looking forward to squaring 
that account, or, I suppose more accurately, having the opportunity to...

Damn. I'm not good at this stuff. To my eternal shame there have been 
times when I could and should have made an effort to contribute to this 
community in times of stress and somehow, I just couldn't do it. But not 
this time.

I really hope you enjoyed that last ride Jeff, right up to the very moment 
that it all went wrong...

This is a very weird experience... I've only been biking for a short period of
time, and Ixion has been part of my window into the new world I'm now
exploring. You get to feel that you know the people on the list, and it's
quite bizarre to feel a genuine sense of loss upon learning that someone
you've never met is no longer with us... but feel it I do, and it's a very
empty and numb feeling.

Please communicate my deepest sympathy to his family and loved ones.

It must be a sign of his generosity 'cos I know I owe him at least a couple

I must confess to descending into a very maudlin frame of mind in these
circumstances; I was shocked when Paul died but I didn't know him. I knew
Jeff; I haven't known many people who have died before their time - my
brother who died at 4 months old; a flatmate who died in New Zealand
mountain climbing; a mate who was epileptic and choked during a fit aged 32;
a colleague of Kathy's who died of cancer in his early 40's; and Jeff. Ever
time it's deeply affected me, and I just know Jeff will be the same.

I guess you just have to make sure you don't get hardened to it, and that
each case is taken as it comes as a tragic loss of humanity. I was hoping to
avoid alcohol for a few days as a way of losing weight and just sorting
myself out a bit; I have to admit I'm currently tucking into a large
Armagnac and it's not my first by a long way - Jeff, the toast is you!
Apologies to the rest of the world if I'm being self-indulgent, but I don't
care....

Three years and six weeks ago today (Thursday, May 21, 1998) I received
a telephone call from Jeff. I had hoped that I'd never again have to
hear the news he gave me. This evening there was a knock at my door and
I was given a variation of the same message but Jeff wasn't the
messenger this time, he was the subject.
I know Jeff enjoyed riding Norway as much as Peter and I did. He
could've been doing anything, in any exotic location in the world but he
chose to ride to the arctic with Pete and me. Thanks for the company,
cock.

Ben, there's never a right thing to say or a right time to say it, and

It's funny<1>, despite having never met Jeff, I find myself very saddened by
his death. Possibly because as bikers it's a risk we live with daily so it
brings the whole thing much closer to home.
To those who knew him, my sympathies.
To his family, my deepest condolences. I can't imagine how you feel right
now and can only hope that you find the strength to get through it.

Lets just hope that Jeff finds himself in a place with no speed limits, no
Gatso's, traffic police and numpties in cages. May all his roads be winding
and dry....

I really hoped I'd never have to read anything like this, and being a
relative newcomer to bikes I certainly hadn't expected it to be so soon.
After less than a year of motorcycling, and already someone I knew (albeit
very briefly) has gone. 

My deepest sympathies to Linda, and also to Marvin and Pete. To Richard,
thanks for keeping us all informed during what must have been a difficult
time for you, too.

I met Jeff once. In that short couple of hours, he did a lot of smiling, and
he made me laugh. Rest in peace, Jeff.

I've never met Jeff or corresponded much with him but
I've been thinking about him a lot in this last week
or so. For the last couple of days I'd been expecting
and looking forward to a post saying he was past the
worst and on the mend - seeing the awful news this
morning has come as quite a shock and I find myself
quite affected by it.

RIP Jeff and deepest condolences to his family and

Oh fsck. The fact that I never knew the guy except online doesn't

box together of things for him to occupy himself with when he came
round, I had fun trying to think of things that someone with two broken

This is the only online community where I feel that it really doesn't

This is exactly how I remember him. I can't picture him when he isn't
smiling, I can't remember his voice that wasn't on the verge of breaking
into a laugh.

We ixies spend so much time without seeing each other that maybe we
shouldn't be affected so much by this kind of thing ... but I am: I'm
sad I'll never enjoy his company again; I'm sad Jeff's not out there
having fun; and I'm _very_ sad for his family and close friends.

My uncle died on Wednesday, I feel guilty that I'm much sadder about
Richard and Jeff.

I know it isn't because we feel nothing - after my own ramblings last night
I came down this morning to read the next batch of tributes, and my face was
streaming with tears again. I'm having to bite my lip typing this sitting
here in the office. I think it's simply that it's one of the most life
changing things we experience, and certainly for me it's something I have
only experienced a few times, so I really don't know how to express my
feelings.

Also a lot of the clich=E9s are clich=E9s because they ARE a true represent=
ation
of how we feel. Everyone says them because everyone shares some of the
emotions and sense of loss.

I think that it is in this situation we can see the benefit of the public
declarations of support; it makes me feel better knowing that the rest of
Ixion is there, and sharing the grieving process.=20

Hope to see some of you at the funeral.

I'm at a bit of a loss for words really. Jeff was an amazing bloke. 
Spend time talking to him and he had experienced life to the full, 
he'd paid his dues through hard work and was out to enjoy his 
retirement and get the most out of it he could. It took so much to 
get him down, always cheerful, smiling, joking, singing (especially 
early in the morning when he knew it wound people up!) Always willing 
to help.

Without him the Ixi Robot wouldn't have happened. Without him I guess 
a lot of stuff wouldn't have got past the good idea stage, his drive 
and optimism always enough to get things going. I remember riding 
across the country to give him support after Paul's death, I remember 
so many things that we've done, good times we've had. Guess I've just 
got to realise that they will be there forever, and whatever comes 
next, Jeff will have sorted out the welcoming banners well in 
advance.

My missus only knew him from that week on the Island and when I passed
on the news that he'd had a bad one on the way back from his visit to
the northernmost parts she made the comment that 'old thin legs' as she
called him 'was the most gentlemanly' of all my biking mates.

She had him sussed and even I, although I knew of his work and
connections, was also mightily impressed.

Feck!! RIP Jeff, wherever you are.

I did not know Jeff very well personally, but in the 18 months or so
I've been on the list we met at numerous Ixion social events. He was
travelling about enjoying his retirement, meeting and making friends,
talking the kind of sensible nonsense that he specialised in and proving
that you can grow old disgracefully in the best possible way.

His recent message from Norway to Jim & Diane at their wedding reception
made me look forward to meeting Jeff again at Mike Caters BHGP trackday
this month. Sadly this was not to be.

RIP Jeff, we will miss you.

As I've just read the digest, and found out, a few comments:

First and foremost, condolences to Linda, and the rest of Jeff's family. No
matter how much
we think *we'll* miss him.....

Secondly, it's just struck me how *few* times I met Jeff, a dozen or so (at
most), and yet 
how good a friend I felt him to be - sign of someone worth knowing, that.

Inevitably, I wish I'd got to know him better. Too bloody late now. Sorry,
mate.

Jeff was a friendly, charming and witty individual, with a talent for the
surreal and 
tangential gag rivalled only by marvin. I'll miss his contribution to the
list, and miss
him even more on the odd occasion I make it to Sherburn.


RIP Jeff.

Dear list,

I don't really know what to say. I met Jeff on a
number of occassions and as others have said he was
one of the nicest people I have met. What is more, he
lived in the same village as my SO's parents and they
had only recently met him at one of the village do's.
My sympathies go out to his family and to Marvin and

experience. And also to Richard, who had the difficult

Goodbye, Jeff.

Nope, if I've learnt one thing these last few weeks, it's that there are
some people who know when and how much to drink! 

My idea of drinking is drink until your eyes close and start drinking
again when they open.

Jeff was one of the few and I don't just mean his drinking habits!

You know,

The thing I remember most vividly about Jeff was the fact that he was
just so damn nice, nothing seems to overshadow that, he was just one of
life's genuine nice guys. I remember sitting in a pub in Manchester
bullshitting away with Jeff and just... Well, it's not important, I'll
just miss the old bugger.

I hadn't spoken to Jeff in a while, or most other people actually, I'm
just so busy, and in the wrong country of course. I suppose I won't have
the chance now, makes me remember what's important I spose.

I mean, you wouldn't think some oiks you met on a mailing list would be
any kind of priority in your life really would you, but when you look at
this "place" as somewhere you talk to friends...

Bizarre how the loss of someone you've never met can have such an impact.
How a mere common interest can make you feel like you know someone..

I can see from the sentiment of the postings on Ixion, that Jeff was a great
friend to many, and will be missed.

I don't rightly know what to say in this message, lest the lump in my throat
could type...
Please pass on my deepest sympathies to Jeff's family, friends and all

I probably only met Jeff a dozen times or so but every single time he was

Jeff, you're missed already :-(

Many thanks to those who kept us informed, a week of tension was perferable

Thanks also to those who have been able to say all the eloquent stuff that I

I'm very glad to say that I was able to have a long chat or 2 with

of someone I was pleased to consider to be my friend.

On the Rumanian trip, he was a source of constant amusement and wit -
with the odd spark of bad temper when he dropped the Starship
Enterprise <g>.  Ever since his christening as such on that trip, I
have thought of him as Ghandi's look-alike, so I am honoured to have
known a minor religious icon ;-)

Subject: Jeff Wain - a big emptiness

I'm sitting here genuinely lost for words :-(

When Ben Lovejoy called me yesterday evening and said that he was calling
about Jeff, my automatic thought was that he had woken up.  Sadly, very
sadly, that was not to be...

I've met Jeff on many occasions - the last time was only three weeks ago, at
Jim Gillespie's stag night, two weeks prior to Jim's wedding to Diane.  Jeff
was his usual ebullient self, sad only that he would miss the wedding itself
due to his trip with marvin to the Arctic Circle!  I'm truly grateful that
he managed to get there and that his accident occurred on the return leg.
As ever, Jeff, in his quietly assuming way, had achieved another goal that
most of us can only dream of having the courage to do.

It was also typical of Jeff that he made special arrangements to get a faxed
message of best wishes from northern Norway to Jim and Diane for their
wedding day.  I've spoken with J&D whilst they've been on their honeymoon in
Scotland, and their thoughts were with him for his recovery as well.

Prior to that, Jeff had been with a few of us on the Isle of Man, for the
2001 Not-TT.  I shared a hotel room with him and with the huge flourescent
yellow jacket that he wore everywhere when he was riding...  Even at this
particular moment, I can't think of it without smiling at the sight.  It
features prominently on the pictures that marvin took in Norway, alongside
his beloved VFR that he managed to smile about even when it was knocked over
in front of him in the Creg carpark. We did wonders with gaffa tape that
day...

And that's not to mention the huge rotating flashing yellow light that he
kept attached to the topbox of whichever bike he was riding, and on one
memorable Eurothrashers occasion illuminated the entire campsite in the
grounds of a French Chateau when we decided that we needed extra light to
keep the wine flowing late at night...

My thoughts go out to those who he leaves behind: to Linda, who I never had
the pleasure of meeting, to friends and family, and of course to all of
those Ixies who met Jeff over the years doing what he loved. We'll all have
our different memories - may they never fade...

Jeff Wain - a Gentleman, a Scholar, a Biker and a Friend.  Rest
peacefully...

Flymo.

I hadn't felt particulaly emotional while reading all the messages on
Ixion about Jeff, until this one.  I suppose it was becuase I hadn't
really met Jeff until the 2001 Not-TT.  We had met at sundry
race meetings etc, but hadn't spent any time in each others
sphere until the TT.

One lasting impression he made on me then though, was that he had
such an interest in other people.  He knew a darn site more about
me than I did about him......just goes to show his caring character.

Jeff, you'll be missed.  But in those words that I've heard at so
many funerals 'I'm just in another room'  So, let's all think of Jeff
as still here and include him in our thoughts and conversations.
Anyway, who is to say that he can't still hear (and cheer) us.....

please, Richard, pass my condolences to his family.

Nice words. On one of the US based lists I'm on there was a thread about the
passing of the last of the Ducati brothers aged 97. One of the Yanks said
that there was a tradition of riding with your pillion pegs down while solo
as a mark of a missing companion. It's sentimental I know, but I gave Jeff a
lift into work this morning....

He and I attended several buildfest and his company was never less than

My deepest condolences to Jeff's family and friends.

Someone here wrote:

"Ixion is more than just a mailing list, it's like a family. And today
we lost a member of that family."

I've been sitting here reading the digest with wet eyes and although it
may seem silly to be affected by the death of someone that you never
met, it's not silly. 
As a relative newcomer to Ixion, I was unprepared for how much the news
of Jeff's accident affected me. If you are like me then you will have
spent much of the last week quietly nervous about his condition,
anxiously reading each message to see how he was faring. But now he's
gone and I'm really pissed off. 

I'm so glad that Richard took the trouble to keep us all up to date, and
especially grateful for him passing on the bad news, although that email
must have been hell to write.

If there's anything I can do, however small, let me know. And when the
time comes, could somebody let us far-flung Ixies know how Jeff's family
would like us to pay our respects (donations to charities, etc.)?

I knew Jeff pretty well - from trackdays and racing usually. His

various garages in various race paddocks over the last three
years. I remember particularly well an unusual act of generosity 
involving Jeff buying a new part for a skint racer that enabled

A very nice bloke, trite though it sounds. And I will miss him at

The first Ixi I ever met was Jeff, shortly followed by Richard and
marv. It was the day of the chicken foot in the egg marv if you
remember. The first big Ixi event I went to was the off road karting
organise by Jeff and Paul Yull. He has been a constant presence in my
Ixion life.

Jeff has slept on my floor, sofa, more times than I care to remember.
He
has been to every Ixi party I have organised. He has been on every Ixi 
holiday I have organised. I have heard him sing hymns, pop songs, opera

and nursery rhymes all loudly, accurately and early. I have ridden with

him, laughed at him and his reflective bikeand with him, and been 
comforted by him after crashing. He has soothed we when I get over 
stressed organising things, encouraged me when down and made me laugh 
riotously. He has spoken to me like a father, a brother, a friend.

I never once failed to get a hug off him. He was rarely angry. He was
fair minded, generous and warm.

I remember crying with laughter when Jeff wore Flossie's hair like a
wig in France.
I remember Jeff walking hand in hand with Kai talking earnestly.
I remember the feeling of family at the Barn House as we stayed with
Jeff before Paul's funeral.
I remember the warmth and hospitality Jeff and Linda showed Kai and
myself and Floss at their new home.
I remember Jeff baiting Jeremy in his lair early in the morning.
I remember searing blindness the first time we saw the starship
enterprise fully spammed up!
I remember Jeff sailing past me at Cadwell, at full tilt boogie, big
grin on face.
I remember money being extracted with Jeff style meneace for the robot.
Not so much menace more a certain knowledge that you would pay up.
I remember marv and Jeff always turned up first for dinner.
I remember the old man always liked to nap after reading the papers.
I remember an erudite, intelligent, open minded man.
I remember he was part of the great birthday frog conspiracy.

I remember I loved him and still do.

Just come back from the funeral. The sense of community and empathy from all
the gathered Ixies made a big difference, far more than you'd expect just
from 'people that you know from a mailing list'. I think Han's right and
Ixion has got something a bit special.

We first met Jeff four years ago, a couple of days after he'd posted to
Ixion that he'd passed his bike test. He said we'd recognise him because
he'd be "the one with the big silly grin". It was true that day and for most
of the time we knew him. It very soon felt like I'd known him all my life
instead of those few short years. A totally decent human being, warm,
endearing, funny, charming and so enthusiastic about life it rubbed off on
people around him and left them richer for it. There won't be another one
like him. You couldn't help but love him - anything else would be like
kicking a puppy. ;o)

Bye Uncle Jeff. We'll miss you.

I think you may be right there.  I met some very nice people today and
yesterday, and felt very privileged to meet you.  I'm sorry it was under sad
circumstances, and I hope we can meet again under better ones.  I hope
no-one minded my being at the funeral today, although I only knew Jeff by

I have a very good friend, the closest thing I have to a brother, who
after a serious car accident spent several weeks unconscious, attached
to machines which breathed for him and fed him.

I remember visiting him every day and listing to the doctors telling
his family and I that he probably wouldn't make it through the night.

I remember the feelings of uselessness and anger as I watched him lie
there. But God obviously wasn't ready for him then and he eventually pulled thr
ough.

I am eternally grateful for his recovery but the feelings I had over
that period of time give me some small measure of the pain Jeff's
friends and family must be suffering now.

I never met Jeff, yet, as others have already said, I feel a genuine
and deep feeling of loss today.

Subject: Jeff Wain

What to say?

I've been thinking a lot since the news of Jeff's death.  About Jeff, about
life, about death, about my attitude to riding bikes, and whether I want to
carry on doing it.

I first met Jeff at Hardraw I think, on the first Absent Friends weekend.  I
met him on numerous occasions at subsequent Ixion events, including
supporting the efforts of the Aardvarks at Zolder.  Maintaining a dignified
distance from the "Horseplay" at Bar Otto after the racing was over.

The last event was the not TT 2001, for Keith's 40th birthday, and McFrames
stag lap.  I think an abiding memory will be an uncharacterstically well
oiled Wain meeting Paul Dunderdale in the pub at Ballaugh, grinning
cheerfully, and slurring, "Ah, you're, erm, Paul, erm, Dunderhead or
something".

I last saw Jeff when we parted company just outside of Lancaster on the way
back from Heysham.  The original plan was that we were going to ride over
the moors together, so that I could meet an old college friend in Bradford.
The weather was so horrible I decided to head straight home down the M6.  I
turned right, and saw the dayglo jacket disappear into the pennine gloom.

Someone has said that nobody really dies until all the things that they set
in motion stop.  All the time that the clock they wound continues to tick,
their influence ticks on with it.  Having sat in the church in Whixley,

Subject: Jeff Wain

What to say?

I've been thinking a lot since the news of Jeff's death.  About Jeff, about
life, about death, about my attitude to riding bikes, and whether I want to
carry on doing it.

I first met Jeff at Hardraw I think, on the first Absent Friends weekend.  I
met him on numerous occasions at subsequent Ixion events, including
supporting the efforts of the Aardvarks at Zolder.  Maintaining a dignified
distance from the "Horseplay" at Bar Otto after the racing was over.

The last event was the not TT 2001, for Keith's 40th birthday, and McFrames
stag lap.  I think an abiding memory will be an uncharacterstically well
oiled Wain meeting Paul Dunderdale in the pub at Ballaugh, grinning
cheerfully, and slurring, "Ah, you're, erm, Paul, erm, Dunderhead or
something".

I last saw Jeff when we parted company just outside of Lancaster on the way
back from Heysham.  The original plan was that we were going to ride over
the moors together, so that I could meet an old college friend in Bradford.
The weather was so horrible I decided to head straight home down the M6.  I
turned right, and saw the dayglo jacket disappear into the pennine gloom.

Someone has said that nobody really dies until all the things that they set
in motion stop.  All the time that the clock they wound continues to tick,
their influence ticks on with it.  Having sat in the church in Whixley,
seeing all Jeff's friends and former work colleagues, and hearing about his
lifetime of achievements, I think it will be a very long time, if ever,
before Jeff Wain really dies.

I am proud that I can call him my friend.

I can only echo everybody else's thoughts on the terrible news - I only met 
Jeff a couple of times at Sherburn and of course knew him via Ixion. It 
seems really strange sat here in the office less than 100 yards from the 
Infirmary in Leeds.


My condolences to his loved ones.

You must be mistaken, I don't ever get my trunk out in public 'cos it's
so difficult to tuck it back into my sock.

Never been drunk in Douglas and also had the missus with me to keep me
under control so it can't have been me - you'd better send me a copy!

I've some video footage of Jeff in the pits at one of the Cadwell Park
do's - he's quite likely on the track bits as well so I may actually
have some of him doing more than his usual shamble ;-)

I was sad when I heard he'd bashed himself up badly but when it ends in
death it's too late to be sad - cheer up lads, save it for the funeral!

Subject: RIP...

Jeff's departure sadly brings up the total of bike 
related deaths to 3 in the last 2 weeks for me, none 
of which eases any pain and all of which fill me with 
a very large void, not because I knew Jeff that well but 
because of the flood of emotions and the accompanying 
feelings of irreversible loss that one feels at times 
like these.

Richard/Marvin/Pete(?) , please pass on our condolences
to his wife and family. My thoughts are with you three
as well for dealing so thoughtfully and helpfully with 
all at this time...

RIP, including those not mentioned today...

Needless to say, if there is anything that needs 
organising, please contact me as I'm off work
from now until towards the end of the month.

I look in on Ixion from time to time, check on the old and new names,
see what everyone is up to. My timing leaves a lot to be desired
,though. Last time I caught the news of Adam's get off, this time the
unfortunate news of Jeff Wain. A faceless name for me but a name
synonymous with Ixion, in life he helped form the character of the list
,now he'll continue with the mythology.

Subject: Celebration of Jeffs Life....


I've already done the grizzling thing, and the walking around alone in the
garden feeling empty bit....

Godspeed Jeff, one of nature's true gentleman, always smiling and making
other people smile...

The last words I ever spoke to Jeff were taking the piss out of his dayglo
jacket at Blyton a few weeks back...In typical style Jeff laughed it all
off,  and rode off into the sunset with a grin on his face....So that's how
I'm thinking of him now....Riding off into the sunset grinning, and most
likely touring through the mountains somewhere with Paul Y....

I'll be celebrating Jeff's life by immersing myself totally in enjoying
myself riding and racing my bike over the next few days...It's what he'd
expect and bugger me, I'm gonna go do it in style....;-)

My heart goes out to Jeff's family naturally, but also heartfelt sympathies
particularly to marvin who has lost two of his greatest friends in tragic
circumstances....marvin I know Jeff would just want you to be marvin and all
that that entails, like getting deliriously drunk, telling crap jokes badly,
embarrasing folk, and stuff like that....

Jeff wouldn't want us to be maudlin, so whilst I feel the same painful loss
as many of you, I'd like to suggest that you think of all the fun times
you've had with Jeff around, and enjoy those pleasant memories as something
that can never be removed.

RIP Jeff and carry on smiling wherever you are.....

Dave L.

So, that's it then.

I was reading the updates from Richard and was
beginning to think that things may be looking up.
Obviously, they took a turn for the worse and
Jeffs not here any more.

Among other things, I remember him at MadTrax with
that bloody big Audi of his - screaming away up
that single track road. The other thing I remember
is that he always seemed to have a smile on his
face and it wasn't like he was smiling at anything
in particular, he just liked smiling.

Over the years, I've seen posts on the list about
his various incidents and thought "The old bugger
will give it up now", but he never did. He always
came back.

He won't be this time and he'll be missed by lots
of people - not just his family.

Condolences to his family, his friends and
everyone else whose lives were touched by Jeff.

And to Jeff, keep smiling mate.

Ged

Mal,

I think your idea is great.

The first time I met Jeff was at the second Ixi Cadwell trackday, both of us
were in the slow group.
I was on my shiny new RVF400 and he was on his top-boxed and panniered
CB400.

After that I met Jeff at a number of the London meets.  He always smiled and
greeted me like an old friend, 
even though I'd only met him in the flesh a couple of times.  

I particularly remember a long walk to a tube station with him after an Ally
Pally meet in 2000.  
He was always interested in what you were saying and it was great listening
to his experiences 
and opinions.

I'm glad I was lucky enough to meet Jeff.  I'll miss him.

Steven

Subject: Memories of Jeff

My enduring memory of Jeff is from some point on our 1999 Romania 
trip to see the total eclipse.  Somewhere in southern France I 
think.  

I was following Jeff down a long, twisty, well surfaced descent.  
Jeff riding his absurdly overloaded GSX1100F complete with 
panniers, top box, flashing orange light on pole, huge George 
cross number plate, BFO chain and a rapidly failing exhaust system.  
Reflective tape stuck *everywhere*.

Almost every bend the wallowing GSX's fairing slapped into the tarmac 
(followed shortly after by the centre and/or side stand) producing a 
great graunching noise and a carpet of sparks before rebounding, 
sending the bike into further spastic shudders.  

Repeat for several miles :-)

Goodbye Ghandi and thanks for all the tent pegs.

Iain.

I met Jeff through the Robot Wars group and had the pleasure of actually
